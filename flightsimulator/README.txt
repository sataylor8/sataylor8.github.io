The project can be viewed at stauffertayl.org/Projects/Graphics/MP2

If for whatever reason my site is down, you can view the project via a simple python server:
	Download Python (It's the best! You should already have it!)
	Navigate an your console/terminal to my folder
	launch the server and type: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
	It should tell you it's running and spit back a port number say 8000
	Open your browser and go to localhost:8000
	Click StaufferTaylorMP2.html

Steer the plane with the arrow keys
