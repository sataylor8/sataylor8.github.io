The project can be viewed at stauffertayl.org/Projects/Graphics/MP3

If for whatever reason my site is down, you can view the project via a simple python server:
	Download Python (It's the best! You should already have it!)
	Navigate an your console/terminal to my folder
	launch the server and type: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" (note: you will need to apend python to your path to launch from terminal/command prompt)
	It should tell you it's running and spit back a port number say 8000
	Open your browser and go to localhost:8000
	Click StaufferTaylorMP3.html

Change the lighting model by pressing 1
